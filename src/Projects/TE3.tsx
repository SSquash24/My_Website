                The TE3 (Testing Equipment 3) for <a href='https://www.skardin.com/'>Skardin</a> was the first project I
                undertook on behalf of a company. The goal was to create a Raspberry-Pi powered device that could interpret
                and display <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DiSEqC'>DiSEqC</a> commands through both an LCD display
                and RS-232. In particular, my job was programming the Rasberry Pi, whilst it was another person's job to
                make the hardware.
